# AKT3ILVT1 - Project
Project Team: Stefan Wei√üensteiner, Marcel Salvenmoser  
Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/samuelcortinhas/apples-or-tomatoes-image-classification/ 

## Progress
* [x] 2 classes (apples and tomatoes)
* [x] collect training, validation and test data
* [ ] implement some CNN, define some experiments
  * [ ] experiment with different learning rates, how does the loss
behave?
  * [ ] decrease the batch size, how does that affect the training?   
* [ ] run training
* [ ] plot loss over iterations
* [ ] run evaluation on test set
* [ ] calculate confusion matrix and accuracy
* [ ] plot receiver operating characteristic [ROC] curve and
calculate area under the curve [AuC]
* [ ] document your findings and your code (e.g Jupyter
Notebook)
* [ ] save model, load model, run inference
